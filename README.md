### Hi folks! 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on being a Backend/DevOps, cloud consultant, and solutions architect to make your business resilient, robust, and scalable.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a ton of stuff related to APIs, message queues services, cloud services (focus AWS), and proficiency in programming languages (or runtime libraries 😬) like Typescript, Node.js, HCL (Terraform), and others...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source/business projects you have, don't be shy, email me 😉. 
- 💬 Ask me about traveling, food, culture, and music.
- 📫 How to reach me: Send an email to me@hendrixroa.com or check my other network socials on https://resume.hendrixroa.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love memes about Tech 😄
